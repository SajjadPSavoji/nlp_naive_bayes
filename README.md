# NLP_naive_bayes

This project is a part of the course AI taught in University of Tehran.
It's goal is to design a naive-bays based classifier to distinguish between two famous poets Sadi and Hafez. 
To do so , two main models were implemented:
1. Bag of Words: which tryes to detect the class of a sentence only by
   comparing the appearance of unique words.
2. position based: which is basically the prev method only it notes the diffrence
   in location while comparing the appearance
